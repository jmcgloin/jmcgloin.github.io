## A Bit About Me

Almost ten years ago I left the field I'd earned a degree in to become a stay-at-home dad.  During that time, I tried my best to keep up with my industry.  I had a few hobbies related to the work I did so I was able to keep involved, somewhat.  As  the years went along and another child arrived, continuing the rather expensive hobbies wasn't quite so feasible; neither was going back to work or school to further or even retain my value.  Coding, however, was an easy and free hobby to pick up (as I already had a computer).  I had done some programming in my past, BAL in my youth, MatLab and C# at university, and I enjoyed doing it.  I'd never looked at anything I'd done as something professional or marketable, but it made for an interesting activity when daddy-life had me stuck in the house in a brief moment of free time.

## Moving Forward With Coding

Although playing around with code was fun, I felt  like I should take some kind of courses to learn some *proper* coding concepts and style.  Again, I wanted to keep it cheap and flexible regarding time (it wasn't yet anything more than a hobby).  I took to EdX and Udemy.  The combination of free and low cost courses with the community and instructor support was exactly what I was looking for.  The problem was that I wasn't really working toward anything.  If other life stuff came up, it was so easy to walk away from coding for days, weeks, or months.  You really need to keep working the muscle you're trying to develop.

Now that my girls are both in school full-time, I'm at a point where getting out of the house and doing something rewarding--both with respect to my interests and monetarily--is something I'm very ready for.  It's a logical step to take  this hobby and see what I can do with it.

## Choosing a Bootcamp

Knowing how I best work and learn, one thing that was very clear was that I would need more structure and support if I want to get confident in my skills enough to ask for money in return.  I could stay with many of the free options that I'd been using and just decide  to be disciplined, but falling back into the role of the one with the maleable schedule would just be too easy.  Additionally, as much as I love the communities around the resources I used, I wanted to get more guidance and feedback from those who were already using their skills professionally.  So, my criteria for choosing a bootcamp were scope of technology taught, structure (not self paced), support from peers and professionals, and the right balance of flexibility and risk if I don't keep up (not a rigid schedule but enough of a cost that I'd be motivated to keep up).

There are a few fully online bootcamps out there these days with varying combinations of structure, tech, support, cost, timeline.  My final decision came down to the structure.  The Part-Time Structured program at Flatiron seemed to give the right level of structure that wouldn't leaving me making excuses for missing my daughters' school events.

## My Impression So Far

While writting this, I'm in my third week of the bootcamp.  I'm in a cohort of (I think) 41 students, and I've met with several of them through peer programming and study groups.  I've also met with my cohort lead and several tech coaches.  The primary means of communication is via Slack where I can contact my cohort lead and peers if I have questions.  I also can ask questions in real time with tech coaches who can walk me through a problem or do screen shares when needed.

A resource I've quite enjoyed is the study group.  There are on average two to four strudy groups per week that I participate in that are either specific to my cohort or open to all interested in the study group's posted topic.  They typically involve screen shares with either the group organizer sharing to cover a topic hot potato style, or students will share and work through prompts or challenges.  While it is a bit uncomfortable to be in the spotlight, getting stuck in front of a group and working together to come to a solution is a really effective way to learn.

I'm not a big fan of the in-browser IDE.  It definitely makes getting up and running quite easy for those who are brand new to coding, so I completely understand and appreciate its implementation.  I  do find that it hides more of the process that I'd like exposure to.  The IDE is not mandatory to use and there are instructions to use a local environment, which I've chosen to do.  I believe, at some point in the future, you are encouraged/required (I'm not sure which) to move away from the in-browser IDE, so the curtain is pulled back eventually.
